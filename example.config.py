name = 'name'  # entirely cosmetic, just shows who you're nagging in the console/file logs and the message response
prefix = 'prefix'  # required, the prefix before the nag command for it to work (e.g, if set to "?", you'd need to write "?nag")
token = 'token'  # required, the bot token from the discord developer portal. you need a valid one for the bot to run
